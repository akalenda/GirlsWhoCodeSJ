# GirlsWhoCodeSJ

Girls Who Code is a nonprofit all about closing the gender gap in STEM, 
and this is its San Jose chapter. You can read about them [here][1].

As capstone to the year, students will be making an interactive 
website, and [this is where it starts][2]. Some basic HTML, a canvas
that animates when clicked on, and of course how to use Git and Github
to save and share your work.

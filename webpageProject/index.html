  <p>I am <span class="supahbig">Sir Grumpycat</span>, and I am <span class="supahbig">lord</span> of this webpage.</p>

  <p><span class="supahbig">Harken</span>, for there are many other things we could put into a webpage, but this is a fine beginning to our journey.</p>
  <p><span class="supahbig">Tired of editing changes online?</span> Want to save your webpage onto your computer and work there, and then upload changes?
     You'll need Git installed on the computer. There's a lot of ways to do it; here's a few:</p>
  <p><span class="supahbig">First option:</span> <a href="https://git-scm.com/">No-frills Git.</a> This requires you to use the 
     "Command Line Interface", where you type things out. It looks like this:

  </p>
  <p><span class="supahbig">Second option:</span> <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop.</a> This is designed specifically to be used with Github and has a nice user interface. Recommended!</p>
  <p><span class="supahbig">Finally:</span> <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis">Other GUI options.</a> If you ever end up using Git with something besides Github, these can be nice. Perhaps you'd like to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">create your very own Git server</a>?</p>

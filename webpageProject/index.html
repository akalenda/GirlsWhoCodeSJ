    <p>Try clicking on the canvas square just below. Also, try clicking on the cat image above. Want to know how it's
        done? Right-click to inspect the web page, then look at the sources. It's a combination of HTML, and the
        Javascript found in catBlink.js!</p>

    <p><span class="supahbig">Harken</span>, for there are many other things we could put into a webpage, but this is a
        fine beginning to our journey.</p>
    <p><span class="supahbig">Tired of editing changes online?</span> Want to save your webpage onto your computer and
        work there, and then upload changes?
        You'll need Git installed on the computer. There's a lot of ways to do it; here's a few:</p>
    <p><span class="supahbig">First option:</span> <a href="https://git-scm.com/">No-frills Git.</a> This requires you
        to use the "Command Line Interface", where you type things out. It looks like this:
        <img src="git00.png" alt="image missing">
    </p>
    <p><span class="supahbig">Second option:</span> <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop.</a> This is
        designed specifically to be used with Github and has a nice user interface. Recommended!</p>
    <p><span class="supahbig">Finally:</span> <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis">Other GUI options.</a> If you
        ever end up using Git with something besides Github, these can be nice. Perhaps you'd like to <a
                href="https://about.gitlab.com/">create your very own Git server</a>?</p>
